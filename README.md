<h1>Meeting Calendar UI</h1>
<br/>
<p>This is the frontend part, built with React Vite as a single page application SPA, as final project in Lexicon Växjö for fullstack developer focusing Java and React.</p>
<p>The project wraps upp larger parts of content covered during the course and time I put into this project was around 3 weeks. Roughly 2 weeks for frontend, 1 weeks for backend and 1 day to move project to Azure, however I had plenty of help from previous workshops and looking back over past lecture material.</p>
<br/>
<p>Main idea for this UI is to look good, be functional and provide a user a dashboard with meeting data to work with, additionally I added contact and login feature and moved this to the cloud as extra.<p/>
<br/>
<p>Main techniques used in this project are React Components, Bootstrap (some vanilla Bootstrap used aswell), Hooks (state, context), Axios and Router with CSS on top.</p>
<p>In order to access functionalites in the UI the user (creator) needs to login, here I was a bit clueless how to save the data in order to make new requests, after some thinking and consulting teacher I came upp with idea of using localStorage to keep the credentials and setting state in context as logged and then a authentication call is enough to login, but by doing so Im thinking that this should be for one user only, the creator, which limits the project a bit but time and knowledge was my limit here so I choose to go this way.</p>
<p>My first idea was to lift the project as webb app but after some tries and reading I understood that this should be published as a static webb app and so I did, also added a react-cookie consent for good practice.</p>
<br/>
<p>I really enjoyed building this:)</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
